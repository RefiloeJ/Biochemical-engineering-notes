    "You are able to measure the concentration of (dry) biomass in gram biomass per liter ($C_X$) with online spectrophotometry. You can also measure the online rate of oxygen uptake per liquid volume of fermenter ($r_O^v$). Given known $C_X$ you can determine the rate of oxygen uptake per gram of biomass. \n",

    "They also tell you that when the organism grows it requires more or less 100 mmol ATP per gram of biomass produced. They also know that this strain generates anabolic $CO_2$ when it grows. So in addition to making $CO_2$ with respiration, it makes additional $CO_2$ when making biomass. To be exact it makes a mol of $CO_2$ for every 10 cmols of biomass formed. That tell you that the ATP for cell maintenance is very small, almost negligible compared to the ATP required for growth.\n",
